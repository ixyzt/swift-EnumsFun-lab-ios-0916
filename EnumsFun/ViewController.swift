//They each flip one card over at a time. Whoever has the highest card wins both cards. Cards increase in value from 2 to Ace. Suits don't matter. If the cards are the same value, then each player flips over another card, and also adds a face-down card. Whoever wins takes all the cards. If the face-up cards are again the same value, then this process repeats until one player wins. The game ends when one player runs out of cards.
